# Learning How To Learn

## Introduction

This project serves as the first assignment for the 5th cohort of Practicum's 10-month Web Developer program. Practicum is a new venture from Yandex, the largest technology company in Russia, running training programs for aspiring web developers, data analysts, and data scientists. The program covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including React & Node), and best practices. This project showcases concepts learned in the first two sprints on Advanced HTML and CSS. 

For this assignment, Practicum provided a brief for a website on "Learning How to Learn" which had to be created from scratch.

## Background

Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches you is how to teach yourself. All you actually do is memorize information in order to regurgitate when you take the test. You get drilled on how to solve specific exercises so that while you know exactly what you need to do when exam time comes around, do you truly understand the subject material? All you've really learned is how to pass that one test. Once that test is over, the information in your head has outlived its usefulness.

**Question**: Knowing how to study is absolutely essential, but for some reason, this point is too often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this?

## Project Scope

The website includes insight on best practices to learn effectively including:
* 5 Learning Strategies from Barbara Oakley, Author and Professor of Engineering at Oakland University 
* "The Feynman Technique" from Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman
* The 10 Principles of rapid skill acquisition by Josh Kaufman, Author of "The First 20 Hours"
